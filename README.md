# DankTitles
The open source solution to the need for titles in Spigot. <br>
This plugin was created by PanteLegacy with the help of Lightning2552 & Fortifier42 as an answer to the apparent lack of prefix 
plugins on Spigot which allowed server administrators to edit & fully customise prefixes with a nice front-end, GUI menu in-game
for players to select the titles.

## Licensing and other legal nonsense
DankTitles is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, and is and always will be open source.
